# JSShowControl
Server based QLab alternative

JS show control runs on nodeJS and uses:
ExpressJS for webserver
Nunjucks for view engine
Bootstrap for css framework

JS show control uses a basic web interface to communicate with a RESTful API which is used to take care designing cues.
JS show control can be controlled from anything that can access an API, or any device that can use a web browser.
